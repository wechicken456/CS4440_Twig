# CS 4440 Twig project tools

## Tools list:

- [shim.py](README.md#shimpy)
- [socket_time.c](README.md#socket_timec)
- [udpping](README.md#udpping)
- [make_pcap.sh](README.md#make_pcapsh)
- [twig_test.sh](README.md#twig_testsh)

## Issues and Clarifications (ongoing updates)

- **(Issue)** `Ctrl+d` or `Ctrl+c` will not stop the shim if it is no longer recieving packets to forward to the pcap file (it only checks if it should stop when it gets another packet) 
	- To stop it then, you can do one of the following
		- Press `Ctrl+d` or `Ctrl+c` as usual, then send and additional packet to the shim using `ping 172.31.128.2` (or using another of the utilities given) 
		- Press `Ctrl+\` to forcibly kill the shim. The shim is multi-threaded, not multi-process, so this will correctly terminate it.
- **(Issue)** The first packet recieved by the shim is often discarded. So assume that the first packet will be lost.
	- I recommend either testing first with `ping` or run `time_socket` first, expecting it to go unanswered.
- **(Clarification)** The shim will display a warning when it writes the first packet:  
	- `WARNING: PcapWriter: unknown LL type for bytes. Using type 1 (Ethernet)`
- **(Clarification)** For debugging there are a few useful tools present.
	- For debugging checksums, Wireshark can check them for you and let you know if they are right or not. To enable this for UDP and IPv4, open wireshark and navigate to:
		- `Edit -> Preferences -> Protocols -> IPv4` and check
			- [x] ` Validate the IPv4 checksum if possible`
		- `Edit -> Preferences -> Protocols -> UDP` and check
			- [x] ` Validate the UDP checksum if possible`
	- For viewing packets as they arrive in the .dmp file we use as a network, the `twig_test.sh` script has the ability to start a live wireshark capture session when it starts the shim. To activate this, run the script with the `-w` option like so:
		```
		./twig_test.sh -w
		```
		Note that this wireshark window will need to be closed manually, as it does not close when the shim is killed.
	- For debugging if the shim is seeing your packets or is missing them, you can add `-d` or `-dd` to the line which runs the shim in `twig_test.sh` i.e. change
		```
		sudo python3 shim.py -n "${IFACE_ARG}" -i "${EXT_IFACE_NAME}"
		```
		to
		```
		sudo python3 shim.py -n "${IFACE_ARG}" -i "${EXT_IFACE_NAME}" -d
		```
		this will make it output a message and a packet summary every time it processes a packet from the pcap file.
## Overview

**Now compatible with scapy Version 2.5.0 as well as 2.6.1**

To run a simple test using these tools, here are the steps:

1. Open 3 terminals in this repository's directory
2. In one terminal, run `./twig_test.sh`
	- Authenticate when requested to start the shim
	- You'll know it is running as expected when you see the line `press ctrl+d to stop `
3. In another terminal, start your `twig` on the network using `./twig -i 172.31.128.2_24` (replace the interface specification if you change the network used in `twig_test.sh`)
4. In the final terminal, you can test using `ping` or `socket_time` (or similar programs that your `twig` can respond to)
The format is `ping 172.31.128.2` or `socket_time 172.31.128.2` (replace the ip address if you change the ip address your `twig` is listening on)


**NOTE: if you are unable to run the scripts, you may need to make them executable using the following commands:**
```
chmod +x twig_test.sh
chmod +x make_pcap.sh
```

Also note that the capture file is not removed when the shim is stopped, this is to make it easier to review if your packets are correct or not, though `make_pcap.sh` or `twig_test.sh` *will **overwrite** existing files* if started with the same network configured. 

## Testing

This section will detail exactly how to run tests that check basic functionality for your twig program.

The basic format for each test will be very similar to the procedure detailed in the [Overview](README.md#overview), but will be careful to avoid known issues and will have a higher level of detail.

Formatting:
- Clarifying comments will be italicized like *this*
- Specific important elements will be bold like **this**
- Placeholder elements of commands will be indicated using angle brackets (`<>`) with a description of the value they represent contained.
- Commands, program names, file names, and single-line output will be isolated in in-line code segments like `this`
- Multiline output and results will be isolated in multiline code blocks like
```
this
```

Notes:
- IP addresses will be specified absolute assuming a default `twig_test.sh`. If you modify `twig_test.sh` all IP addresses will need to be updated to follow. Additionally, IP addresses specified for use with `twig`, `ping`, `socket_time`, and `udpping` are assumed to be used exactly as written. modifying the IP in any stepp will require modifying it in all related steps.
- Each test has the same shutdown process, and the same startup process for the shim and twig.
	- To run **all tests** quickly, you can simply perform **steps 1-5** from any of the following test sections, then perform **steps 6+** from each test in any order sequentially **without performing shutdown in-between.**

### Test 1 (ICMP Ping)

#### Procedure
1. Open 3 terminal windows, each with this repository as their working directory.
2. Create a symbolic link to your twig program in the local directory by running the following command in **terminal 1**: `ln -s <your twig directory>/twig ./twig `
	- *Make sure to replace `<your twig directory>` with the directory your twig program is present in, and ensure you have a binary named `twig` in that directory.*
3. In **terminal 1**, run `./twig_test.sh`
	- Authenticate when prompted
	- *You'll know it is running as expected when you see the line `press ctrl+d to stop `*
4. In **terminal 2**, start your `twig` on the pcap file's network by running the command `./twig -i 172.31.128.2_24`
	- *this gives your twig an interface with IP `172.31.128.2` on the network `172.31.128.0/24`*
5. In **terminal 3**, run `./socket_time 172.31.128.2`, then press `Ctrl+c` to stop `socket_time`.
	- *This is to get around the issue of the first packet being ignored...* 
6. In **terminal 3**, run the command `ping -c 15 172.31.128.2` 

#### Shutdown

For shutting down, there is a known issue witht he shim, so follow these steps to shut down cleanly:
1. In **terminal 3**, run `ping 172.31.128.2`
	- *This will give packets to the shim and let it check for the shutdown signal. (See [Issues](README.md#issues-and-clarifications-ongoing-updates).)*
2. In **terminal 1**, press `Ctrl+d`
	- *`test_twig.sh` should stop running within a second, when `shim.py` recieves a packet.*
3. In **terminal 3**, press `Ctrl+c`
	- *`ping` should stop immediately.*
3. In **terminal 2**, press `Ctrl+c`
	- *`twig` should stop immediately*

#### Expected Results

The output of the `ping` client from **step 6** is what matters. 

Example **Good** output in **terminal 3** from **step 6**:
```
sspringer-fedora-Twig-tools: ping -c 15 172.31.128.2
PING 172.31.128.2 (172.31.128.2) 56(84) bytes of data.

64 bytes from 172.31.128.2: icmp_seq=10 ttl=20 time=23.8 ms
64 bytes from 172.31.128.2: icmp_seq=11 ttl=20 time=13.7 ms
64 bytes from 172.31.128.2: icmp_seq=12 ttl=20 time=22.7 ms
64 bytes from 172.31.128.2: icmp_seq=13 ttl=20 time=23.9 ms
64 bytes from 172.31.128.2: icmp_seq=14 ttl=20 time=21.7 ms
64 bytes from 172.31.128.2: icmp_seq=15 ttl=20 time=19.5 ms

--- 172.31.128.2 ping statistics ---
15 packets transmitted, 15 received, 0% packet loss, time 14025ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 13.718/20.374/27.581/3.946 ms
```

Key components to make sure are correct:
- 0% packet loss
- no `(DUP!)` warnings on any responses

##### Common issues and causes:

- If the first packet (response where `icmp_seq=1`) is missing, verify **Step 5** was performed. If Shutdown has not yet been performed, you may repeat **Step 6** and check the output of that new run.

- If other packets are missing, check first if the `172.31.128.0.dmp` file contains all requests but not all expected responses. 
	- If it does, the issue likely lies with your twig not replying to everything
	- If it does not, the issue is likely with t e shim - contact me (Silas) and we'll figure it out.

- If warnings with `(DUP!)` are present, the issue is likely either:
	- Two `twig`s are running simultaneously with the same interface IP and both are responding
	- The one running `twig` is not correctly keeping its place in the pcap file, so is reading the request multiple times.

### Test 2 (UDP Ping)

#### Procedure
1. Open 3 terminal windows, each with this repository as their working directory.
2. Create a symbolic link to your twig program in the local directory by running the following command in **terminal 1**: `ln -s <your twig directory>/twig ./twig `
	- *Make sure to replace `<your twig directory>` with the directory your twig program is present in, and ensure you have a binary named `twig` in that directory.*
3. In **terminal 1**, run `./twig_test.sh`
	- Authenticate when prompted
	- *You'll know it is running as expected when you see the line `press ctrl+d to stop `*
4. In **terminal 2**, start your `twig` on the pcap file's network by running the command `./twig -i 172.31.128.2_24`
	- *this gives your twig an interface with IP `172.31.128.2` on the network `172.31.128.0/24`*
5. In **terminal 3**, run `./socket_time 172.31.128.2`, then press `Ctrl+c` to stop `socket_time`.
	- *This is to get around the issue of the first packet being ignored...* 
6. In **terminal 3**, move to the udpping directory with `cd udp_ping`
7. In **terminal 3**, compile udpping (if not done already) with `make`
8. In **terminal 3**, run the command `udpping 172.31.128.2` 

#### Shutdown

For shutting down, there is a known issue witht he shim, so follow these steps to shut down cleanly:
1. In **terminal 3**, run `ping 172.31.128.2`
	- *This will give packets to the shim and let it check for the shutdown signal. (See [Issues](README.md#issues-and-clarifications-ongoing-updates).)*
2. In **terminal 1**, press `Ctrl+d`
	- *`test_twig.sh` should stop running within a second, when `shim.py` recieves a packet.*
3. In **terminal 3**, press `Ctrl+c`
	- *`ping` should stop immediately.*
3. In **terminal 2**, press `Ctrl+c`
	- *`twig` should stop immediately*

#### Expected Results

The output of the `udpping` client from **step 8** is what matters. 

Example **Good** output in **terminal 3** from **step 8**:
```
sspringer-fedora-udp_ping: ./udpping 172.31.128.2
Sending 1000 udp echo requests of size 50 to 172.31.128.2 on port echo
 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900


time spent waiting for echos to return (in milliseconds):
# sent  # rcvd  # late       total        min       max       avg
------  ------  ------  -----------  --------  --------  --------
  1000    1000       0    21688.166    11.206    49.648    21.688 
0.00% packet loss
```

Key components to make sure are correct:
- 0.00% packet loss

##### Common issues and causes:

- Similar to ICMP Ping, you may have dups or missing packets, I recommend debugging those on the ICMP side when possible.
- Debugging missing packets may be simpler with lower numbers, which canbe achieved by specifying how many packets to send with the `-c` option to udpping.		
	- Then check the `172.31.128.0.dmp` file with wireshark.
	- Most likely cause for no responses is a bad checksum.



### Test 3 (socket_time)

#### Procedure
1. Open 3 terminal windows, each with this repository as their working directory.
2. Create a symbolic link to your twig program in the local directory by running the following command in **terminal 1**: `ln -s <your twig directory>/twig ./twig `
	- *Make sure to replace `<your twig directory>` with the directory your twig program is present in, and ensure you have a binary named `twig` in that directory.*
3. In **terminal 1**, run `./twig_test.sh`
	- Authenticate when prompted
	- *You'll know it is running as expected when you see the line `press ctrl+d to stop `*
4. In **terminal 2**, start your `twig` on the pcap file's network by running the command `./twig -i 172.31.128.2_24`
	- *this gives your twig an interface with IP `172.31.128.2` on the network `172.31.128.0/24`*
5. In **terminal 3**, run `./socket_time 172.31.128.2`, then press `Ctrl+c` to stop `socket_time`.
	- *This is to get around the issue of the first packet being ignored...* 
6. In **terminal 3**, compile socket_time (if not done already) with `make socket_time`
7. In **terminal 3**, run the command `./socket_time 172.31.128.2` 

#### Shutdown

For shutting down, there is a known issue witht he shim, so follow these steps to shut down cleanly:
1. In **terminal 3**, run `ping 172.31.128.2`
	- *This will give packets to the shim and let it check for the shutdown signal. (See [Issues](README.md#issues-and-clarifications-ongoing-updates).)*
2. In **terminal 1**, press `Ctrl+d`
	- *`test_twig.sh` should stop running within a second, when `shim.py` recieves a packet.*
3. In **terminal 3**, press `Ctrl+c`
	- *`ping` should stop immediately.*
3. In **terminal 2**, press `Ctrl+c`
	- *`twig` should stop immediately*

#### Expected Results

The output of the `socket_time` client from **step 7** is what matters. 

Example **Good** output in **terminal 3** from **step 7**:
```
sspringer-fedora-Twig-tools: ./socket_time 172.31.128.2
The time on 172.31.128.2 is 0xed9296eb
```

Key components to make sure are correct:
- The output timestamp is in big-endian (network byte order) hex, complies with the  `1 Jan 1900` timestamp specified by the RFC, and when converted to human readable format is close to the current time.
	- You can convert this to human readable format using the following steps:
		- Convert to local byte order (little-endian in this example): `0xeb9692ed` 
		- Convert to decimal: `3952513773`
		- Subtract the time offset to convert from the `1900` epoch to the unix standard `1970` epoch timestamp: `1743524973`
		- Convert unix timestamp to human readable format `2025-04-01 12:29:33` 
	- Then just check that the time it converts to is within a few minutes of the current time. (*if something is wrong it'll usually be years wrong, not minutes wrong*) 


##### Common issues and causes:

- Time appears incorrect despite a correct conversion method
	- usually caused by a failure to convert the timestamp on to big endian within `twig`, or a failure to convert from the unix standard `1970` epoch to the [RFC 868](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc868.html) `1900` epoch

## shim.py

### Description
The shim sits between the pcap file we use as an interface for twig and the real network. 

The shim uses a direct forwarding mechanism, so we can only talk to things on the same local machine as the shim/twig. It also only forwards ipv4 packets which are

- In the pcap file, from the network that file represents,and destined to something not on that network

or

- On the real interface specified and destined to the network the pcap file represents.


### Requirements

To run the shim you will need the following:

- Python `3.X` (tested with `3.12.2`)
- Python module `scapy`
- (Usually) Default modules `threading`, `socket`, `ipaddress`, `sys`, `signal`, `json`, `netifaces`, `argparse`

Installing `scapy` (and any other reported missing modules) will require either:

1. Using a virtual environment for python such as via `venv` 
2. Installing scapy with root via `sudo pip install scapy` or `sudo apt install python3-scapy`

**NOTE: running the shim requires root access since it is accessing your network interface to sniff for packets and is injecting packets 'sent' from the pcap file.**

## socket_time.c
socket_time.c is a minimal client for the Time Protocol (udp port 37) specified by [RFC 868](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc868.html)

Compile manually or using the built in `make` rules by running 
```
make socket_time
```

then you can request time from any machine running the time server on port 37.

(you can test it on `132.235.1.1`)

Output is in the format 

```
The time on 132.235.1.1 is 0x214b8feb
```

Note that the timestamp `0x214b8feb` is in big endian, hex, and is seconds since `00:00 1 January 1900 GMT` as specified in the RFC. 

Converted to  a human readable format, it is 

```
Thursday, March 27, 2025 3:57:21 AM GMT
```

## udpping
udpping is a basic client for the udp echo protocol.

This client was written by Dr. Shawn Ostermann.

The source code is included in the subdirectory `udp_ping`

To compile, run `make` in the `udp_ping` subdirectory.

By default, testing with `udpping`  will send 1000 packets, and give a summary of results at the end, presuming not all of them were discarded or lost.

`udpping -` will output usage with more details on how to refine your testing.

Testing details to follow in [Testing](README.md#testing)


## make_pcap.sh

This script serves to make an empty pcap file with some default header parameters.

run using the format 

```
./make_pcap.sh <pcapfilename>
```

e.g.

```
./make_pcap.sh 172.31.128.0_24.dmp
```

or just use twig_test.sh to start the shim and make the pcap file at the same time.

## twig_test.sh

### Description

This script creates a pcap file with network `172.31.128.0/24`, tries to determine and use your default interface, and starts a copy of [shim.py](README.md#shimpy) between that pcap file and the determined interface.

To close down the shim this script starts, simply use `ctrl+d` or `ctrl+c` in the terminal it is running in*.

(*) - see [Issues and Clarifications](README.md#issues-and-clarifications-ongoing-updates)

If `-w` is provided as an additional argument to this script when started, it will establish a wireshark session which live-captures from the network pcap file. NOTE: this session doesnt close automatically when you kill the shim, it will need to be closed manually.

If your default interface contains spaces, edit the script to have the name already specified or enable it to take the interface as an argument. Comments in the script identify where to do this.

To use a new network address from the default, edit the script to use your chosen network (non-public IPs only) or enable it to take the network as an argument. Comments in the script identify where to do this.

**NOTE: This script will prompt for password since you need root to run the shim.**

### Requirements

This script has all the requirements to run shim, and additionally uses lots of BASH specific expansions such as the arithmetic expansion notation `$(( <expr> ))`.

## Docker Container Runtime (WIP)

With the new modifications made to the shim for it to be functional on macos, and the future movement to reduce the strict filters in place on incoming traffic to allow multiple subnets behind the single shim, we've built a docker based arrangement to run your twig and the shim inside of.

This new version of the shim can only communicate with remote hosts, it cannot do loopback connections. So docker allows us to abstract this and do loopback connections in a way that appears as a remote connection to the shim.
Additionally, docker allows us to have a strict environment and allow better portability across systems.

commands (WIP)
```
docker build -t twigimage .
docker network create --subnet=172.31.127.0/24 twignet
sudo ip route add 172.31.128.0/24 via 172.31.127.254

docker run --name twigcontainer --net twignet --ip 172.31.127.254 --mount type=bind,src=/home/sspringer/Desktop/Schooling/TA/2025_OUCS_4440/shrub-SilasSpringer,dst=/usr/local/shrub-SilasSpringer --mount type=bind,src=.,dst=/usr/local/twig --rm -it twigimage bash

docker exec -it twigcontainer bash
	./twig -i 172.31.128.2_24
```

TODO: change the command for running the docker container to correctly have placeholders for the file paths
TODO: resolve response duplication...
